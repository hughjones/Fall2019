Political and Social Thought, Class of 2021

> I've long believed in the power of technology to transform society for the better, although for many years I believed that *technology alone* would be enough. In hindsight, such a view was naive and dangerous. Much of my interest today is rooted in leveraging the very best technology has to offer us in an intentional, thoughtful manner while mitigating negative side effects, all in the interest of the public good. With all this in mind, I'm very excited for this semester of Gov Lab!

### Class 2 - Content Moderation and Online Speech

[It's the (Democracy-Poisoning) Golden Age of Free Speech](https://www.wired.com/story/free-speech-issue-tech-turmoil-new-censorship/)

This is a thoughtful piece by one of my favorite (self-declared) techno-sociologists, Zeynep Tufekci. In it, Tufekci identifies a number of fallacious assumptions made by the architects of our digital world and the manner in which each has yielded the opposite of the utopia we were promised such tools would achieve. In her own words, we have learned that "when free speech is treated as an end and not a means, *it is all too possible to thwart and distort everything it is supposed to deliver*."

### Class 3 - Algorithmic Bias

[Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative](https://cyber.harvard.edu/topics/ethics-and-governance-ai)

Media Justification: I had the privilege of working at the Berkman Klein Center the summer before last on their burgeoning "Ethics and Governance of AI" initiative. Throughout the summer, we examined a plethora of different use cases for contemporary artificial intelligence techniques/practices and considered how such technologies can be harnessed in support of the public interest. I wanted to share this link with our class because it is an aggregate overview of the initiative and the various projects and discussions that have emerged from it.

### Class 3 - Algorithmic Bias

[Zittrain and Zuckerberg discuss encryption, ‘information fiduciaries’ and targeted advertisements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGchhsKhG-A)

In this fascinating (albeit lengthy) video, Jonathan Zittrain of the Berkman Klein Center and Mark Zuckerberg discuss some of the most fundamental challenges facing both Facebook as a company and society at large at the present moment. Of the issues discussed, the two cover various approaches and proposals for regulatory practices (either enforced by the company itself or by an external legislative body) which could benefit the company and the communities it is intended to serve.

### Class 4 - The Right to be Forgotten

[Why Journalists Shouldn't Fear Europe's 'Right to be Forgotten'](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/why-journalists-shouldnt-fear-europes-right-to-be-forgotten/251955/)

A fascinating piece published in the Atlantic on the day in 2012 during which the Right to be Forgotten was passed into E.U. law. Looks specifically into the implications of the legislation for journalism, which was (and remains) a significant concern. Interesting to see the dimensions of the discussion which remain highly relevant and those which have shifted since the legislation's inception.

### Class 5 - Data Ownership and Privacy

[A Grand Bargain to Make Tech Companies Trustworthy](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/)

The aforementioned Jonathan Zittrain has been a staunch proponent of altering our legal frameworks such that technology companies dealing with sensitive user information must operate under a fiduciary agreement with their users. Such a policy would hold companies legally responsible for protecting the interests and privacy of their users, as well as ensure that users have a bigger say in the manner in which their data is handled.

### Class 6 - Surveillance Capitalism

[How the Trump Campaign Used Facebook Ads to Amplify His ‘Invasion’ Claim](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/us/politics/trump-campaign-facebook-ads-invasion.html)

The Trump campaign has, within the American context, been one of the foremost beneficiaries of Facebook's self-service ad targeting tool, and has leveraged the companies surveillance technologies in order to precisely pinpoint audiences it predicts will be susceptile to specific messages and themes. In such an example, the technologies which drive surveillance capitalism are leveraged by a political demagogue and used as weapons against the democratic process.

### Class 7 - Social Media & Democracy

[The Dark Psychology of Social Networks](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/social-media-democracy/600763/)

In this *Atlantic* piece, Jonathan Haidt and Tobias Rose-Stockwell discuss the manner in which the design incentives that have shaped our existing social media ecosystem have produced a social and political climate that is toxic to democracy.

### Class 8 - Bad Gov Tech & Its Consequences

[Obama's US Digital Service Survives Trump—Quietly](https://www.wired.com/story/obamas-us-digital-service-survives-trumpquietly/)

This article details the manner in which USDS-- Barack Obama's 2014 initiative to leverage the technical expertise of Silicon Valley to streamline the systems upon which our government runs-- has continued to operate, albeit far more subtly, under the Trump administration.

### Class 9 - Digital Discourse

[JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change](https://www.edx.org/course/juryx-deliberations-for-social-change)

Charles Nesson, founder of the Berkman Klein Center, has been experimenting with new modes of discourse in digital spaces. Such efforts have culminated with the most recent release of Professor Nesson's HarvardX online course, JuryX, in which participants enagage with emotionally charged issues online in a rational and engaging format and setting. Worth further exploration.

### Class 10 - Current Tech Policy

[Contract for the Web](https://contractfortheweb.org/)

Tim Berners-Lee and colleagues recently introduced a new social contract for the internet. The project, called Contract for the Web, includes imperatives for governments, individuals and corporations in an effort to protect an open internet in service of humanity.
